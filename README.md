#  Isack Ouma Mwangasu

**`Digital Craftsman (Developer/Filmmaker/Creator)`**

I'm a Front-end Developer and content creator building my version of the digital world one step at a time. All coding projects are built from the ground up, from planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems with code. All video content is built the same way, from ideation and planning, all the way to finalizing the content with artistic touches. I publish that content on my Instagram.

### About Me
<details>
 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª Isack's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I am Isack, a dedicated and passionate Software Engineer specializing in Frontend Web Development. With skills in React, JavaScript, HTML, and WordPress, I excel at bringing ideas to life through code. As a Frontend Software Engineer, I thrive on creating solutions to real-world problems, always aiming to build scalable and high-quality products or services that positively impact the community.
   My coding journey began as a naive computer science student eager to learn everything about programming, from UNIX and Linux to software development theory. I started my learning at Moringa School, then advanced to St. Paul's University to pursue a degree in Computer Science.
   In addition to my academic journey, I am also a media manager at Angular Kenya and a content creator for my own Instagram page. I am driven by a strong desire to make a difference through technology and actively seek opportunities that challenge me to grow and allow me to contribute to meaningful projects.
